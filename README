CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]



----------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:


Program stops responding for values more than 10000000000
Program could not show proper bars in the window even though it showed correct values for number greater than 100000000
----------------------------------------------
ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:


Could not test if I have used Font rendering codes(code snippet given in the assignment for dimension of the label) correctly.
----------------------------------------------
ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

1. In CS455 we are encouraged to study together however we are not allowed to include any code snippet from the web.
Any code not written by me should be mentioned in the README file under outside sources used column.


2. we can get following results if we toss two coins,
HH
TT
HT
TH
So theoretically we can say that,

probability of two heads = 0.25
probability of one head and one tail = 0.5
probability of two tails = 0.25
 

3. To get the results mostly within the 1% of these probabilities, I would say number of trials should be atleast more than 500.
Or in general trials more than 1000 gives almost the mentioned probabilities.


4. The program worked for 1000000000(10^9) but very slow and sometimes says "Java se stopped responding"
   The program crashed and gave the below error for value greater than 10000000000(10^10)
